# Thinkfulbnb

## Summary

Thinkfulbnb is a vacation rental website that allows people to rent out their homes to people who are seeking short-term accommodations in that locale. Thinkfulbnb hosts rent out different kinds of properties, including single rooms, apartments, and unique living spaces such as yachts, houseboats, yurts, tiny houses, and even renovated medieval castles. This project focused on created a responsive webpage that changed with the size of the window it is viewed on. This was done with a focus on using flex boxes in HTML and CSS.

## Technology

- HTML
- CSS

## Created Features

### Nav Bar

The navigation bar in the top right of the screen was created to move responsively to always show all 4 options just in different formats. Each word is also linked to it's corresponding section within the page.

### HTML Form

The form with Location, Arrive, etc... is responsive to the size of the screen and gradually goes from all horizontal to vertically stacked as the screen shrinks all while staying inside the pink outline.

### About Section

The about section consistently adjusts so that the two pictures stay the same size as each other and only take up half the section while the words take up the other half until they stack on top of each other.

### Ideas Section

The ideas section shrinks as a 4x4 grid all staying the same size as the others until stacking vertically in the mobile view.

###  Become a Host Section

The become a host section also shrinks in a way that lets the words take up just the left side of the screen and the picture take up an equal width on the right side until stacking in the mobile view.
